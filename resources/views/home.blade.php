<h2>About this project</h2>
<hr>
<p>This app is being built for training purposes. This is my first app with Laravel. I am using Laravel 5.6 with Bootstrap 4.0 Elements. The idea is t create a simple tracker for gym activities and for the user to keep diary of the food intake. The system gives the user <thead>
  ability to view the postings history. This has no login system yet, therefore everything is public, including the posts made by ANYONE.
